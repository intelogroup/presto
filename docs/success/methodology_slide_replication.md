## Key Success Factors

*   **Granular Control:** `pptxgenjs` provided the necessary functions to control the exact `x` and `y` coordinates, as well as the dimensions (`w`, `h`) of all shapes and text boxes.
*   **JavaScript Ecosystem:** Leveraging JavaScript allowed for a more dynamic and flexible approach to scripting the slide generation logic.
*   **Rich Feature Set:** The library supports adding images, shapes, and text with a wide range of styling options, which was crucial for this task.
